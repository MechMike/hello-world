Notes about the Author:
Hello, I'm Mike! I am a college student looking to increase my knowledge of web development and coding languages to get a source of well-paying secondary income for college. Luckily, I enjoy science and technology, so I will hopefully not have to work a day of my life, as Mark Twain once said.
